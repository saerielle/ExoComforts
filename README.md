# ExoComforts
ExoComforts mod for the game I Was a Teenage Exocolonist.

## Description
A set of small, modular QoL tweaks: skip the intro dream, see birthday bubbles with gift hints, choose the date event scenes, postpone more expedition events, and a few tiny fixes for the overly observant.

## Features
* **Intro Dream Ski**p: optionally skip the intro dream sequence and jump straight to the intro title screen on subsequent lives
* **Birthday Reminders**: Sol remembers birthdays even if you don't. If you have unlocked information about someone's birthday, they will get a conversation bubble when the time comes - plus flavor text showing their likes and sometimes dislikes (if unlocked), unless you have gifted them this month already or your friendship is maxed. Supports base game characters as well as characters from ExtraColonist and Gestalt Expansion.
* **Date Picker**: choose which date event plays out with romanceable characters, instead of leaving it up to RNG gods
* **"Get Back Later" Patch**: adds return-later option to many more expedition events in the first four exploration zones (excludes hunt and spoiler zone). No more save scumming because you are on 100 Perception and this specific event gives Sol too much stress
* **Bar Building Reminders**: If the quest to help a friend build the bar has started, you will see a conversation bubble that would remind you when gifting is available.
* **Minor Fixes**: NPC dialogue color in a few obscure places (no, Vace, you will not talk in generic NPC colors!); overworld sprite change on two expedition events to better reflect the story within them; encountering mysterious stranger who warns you to not go that way will give the mysterious stranger card and advance that plotline; updated bestiary based on the idea and proposed solution by Skypher from EEC Discord
* **Skill Stories Highlights**: All befriendable characters as well as mom and dad have extra mini-stories that are accessible when you reach a certain skill threshold. This patch creates a conversation bubble above their heads when you reach said thresholds, so there is no need to run around checking those :) Currently only supports base game characters.
